# TheCollective (formerly 'Yet Another Kali Linux Scripts Repo' or YAKSR) :
![YAKSR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6934294/46578116-da19ee80-c9bb-11e8-9978-69c6f2561ddc.jpg)

# Summary:

While TheCollective has a script to install/update a install of everything, I recommend you only install the repos you want and look up the file (catigory) you want and find the tool from there you wish to use and install just that one. Use a search command in linux to find what you want from directory tree.

This repo contains mostly a collection pointers to scripts, apps, repos, and/or programs that I have found useful during my time on Red Team Ops. 

I maintain the collection of what is basically pointers to the repos here so I only have 1 place to go to get them all and not have to remember them all. 

Setup, install, or bugs with the downloaded repos should be submitted to the owner of the repo.
I did not create or maintain any of the repos downloaded from any other profile that is not "ceramicskate0".
Actually we all should try to create detections for these and their variations as well as for everything they do ;D

For a complete list of repos please view my starred repos.

# Keep this in mind:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
When using this repo's setup/update scripts you need to be aware that you are downloading source from Github. ALL of the source from each repo you download. This can be ALOT of storage requirements for your machine. If this is an issue for you I recommend you delete the *.txt file(s) you do not wish to use or edit the file by deleteing repos you dont want.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

# For the Blue Team:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
     For the die hard Blue Teamers here. I know its hard, belive me I do. And Repos like this make life seem harder...well unless you use this Repo to your advantage.
     Also to help ive created "Yet Another Blue Team Repo" (YABTR) for the Blue team to help fight/find Red/TheCollective. And now SWELF to help with logging.

# "Support":

--------------------------------------------------------------------
     Currenlty im only using this on Kali Linux and Parrott. 
     I guess the github scripts would work on other Linux distros if you have all the packages (nope im not doing anything for that).
--------------------------------------------------------------------

# Legalish Disclaimer:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
I dont recommend or condone using anything on here for any reason. Anything in the Lists Dir i did not write so I cant exactly tell you what or how it does what it says it does. The scipts here may work, but just as likely have a chance to break the system they are run on. If you use them you do so at your own risk. I do/have NEVER authorized,condoned, or recommend the use of anything in any of my repos for any reason. This is a collection of simple scripts I found useful with my own Kali OS for educational purposes only. I did not create any of the scripts downloaded via the install.py script. All credit goes to the authors whos full URL and/or github account/Repo is listed in the script, please see their sites for more info or issue with their repo's. It should be noted that since these are all publically available. Do not use for evil, malicious purposes, or on machines you do not own.
